# Project 7 - A deep learning model to relate Covid19-related deaths and air quality in New York, Milan and Tokyo

In this project, we aim to gain some insides about the relationship between air quality and Covid19-related deaths. The analysis is based on publicly available air quality and health data from three metropoles (New York, Milan and Tokyo). 

## General

The project showcases:
- data import from various sources <br/>
- data cleaning & quality checks <br/>
- creation of proxy variables <br/>
- data merging
- plotting
- a deep learning approach using *tensorflow* & *keras*

The architecture is based on the paper **The nexus between COVID-19 deaths, air pollution and economic growth in New York state: Evidence from Deep Machine Learning** [[Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479721003030)] by *Cosimo Magazzino, Marco Mele and Samuel Asumadu Sarkodie*.
  
## Project Structure

The `data` folder contains the project data, while the `ref` folder contains the project paper. The code in `scripts/final_script.ipynb`, runs through the process and saves the plots into `figures`.
